    <h3><b>Interesting Experience</b></h3>
    <p>
      At that time after school at 02.00 p.m because of the full day system, I felt tired and I fell asleep immediately when I got home. After waking up from sleep I was surprised because I saw that the sky outside was exactly the same as
      in the morning. I immediately rushed to get ready to go to school because I felt that I was too late to see the wall clock which I thought was showing 05:45 a.m when what actually happened was 05:45 p.m .
    </p>

    <p>
      My mom and dad laughed seeing me getting ready to put on my school uniform and they didn't tell me what really happened. while laughing because of his child's strange behavior. my father and mother finally told me when I was about to
      go to school, and there I felt very embarrassed while laughing with my strange behavior.
